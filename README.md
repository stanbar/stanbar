Software developer and PhD candidate in informatics. I love reading, thinking, writing and programming.

Professionally, my research interests are in the area of blockchains, cryptocurrencies, cryptography, distributed systems, and zero-knowledge proofs.

As a hobby, my research interests are in the area of mathematical and cognitive psychology, and philosophy.

My lifelong side project is a personal decision algorithm for optimizing flow experience using self-surveying and machine learning.

Key values in my life are 💡Usefulness, 🏍️Efficiency, 🧠Openness, 🍎Simplicity, and 🌎Freedom.
