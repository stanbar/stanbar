Security-focused Software Engineer and PhD candidate at Gdańsk University of Technology. My research centers on privacy-preserving distributed systems — trust quantification, secure protocol design, and formal threat modeling under adversarial assumptions. Close to a decade of production engineering experience, from consumer products at scale to backend systems and ML pipelines. I also write about how people work — meaning, identity, and why we do what we do.
