Security-focused Software Engineer with a strong research background in blockchains, privacy-preserving distributed systems, applied cryptography, MPC, and threat modeling. Nearly a decade of full-stack engineering experience, shipping and maintaining production systems used by hundreds of thousands of users. PhD in Information Technology (expected 2026).  I also write about how people work — meaning, identity, and why we do what we do.
